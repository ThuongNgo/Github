            plum Village is where Thay has realised his dream of building a Beloved Community: creating a healthy,
            nourishing environment where people can learn the art of living in harmony with one another and with the
            Earth.

            Plum Village began in 1982 as a small, rustic farmstead, and has today grown into Europe’s largest Buddhist
            monastery, with over 200 resident monks and nuns, living and practising in four different hamlets spread out
            across the French countryside. It is a continuation of the original “Sweet Potato Community” that Thay first
            founded near Paris in the 1970s, soon after he was exiled from Vietnam.
