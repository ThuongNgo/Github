            According to the Larger Sūtra of Immeasurable Life, Amitābha was, in very ancient times and possibly in
            another system of worlds, a monk named Dharmākara. In some versions of the sūtra, Dharmākara is described as
            a former king who, having come into contact with Buddhist teachings through the buddha Lokeśvararāja,
            renounced his throne. He then resolved to become a Buddha and to create a buddhakṣetra (literally-
            "buddha-field", often called a "Pureland" or "Buddha Land" a realm existing in the primordial universe
            outside of ordinary reality, produced by a buddha's merit) possessed of many perfections. These resolutions
            were expressed in his forty-eight vows, which set out the type of Pureland Dharmākara aspired to create, the
            conditions under which beings might be born into that world, and what kind of beings they would be when
            reborn there.
